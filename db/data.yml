    - I love the reminder that if you believe, you have to act in accordance with this belief.  To often we (or at least I) forget that believing is only the first step of a process, not an end in itself.

      <p>
      I love this scripture.  It has been my favorite since just before my mission.
      </p><p>
      I think one of the greatest concepts in it is the concept of being filled with light as you keep yourself close to God.
      </p>
      <bq>...and the body that is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</bq>

    - While waiting for a temple session to start, I dawned on me that this sounds an aweful lot like a lense.  If your lense is full of light, you can see a lot, and see it clearly.  If, houwever, your lense is dirty and in covered up, what little light gets through is obscured.

    - I love how it this set of scriptures leads you from believing in Christ takes you to repentance, to what a belief that you must repent means.  I also love the admonition to "do these things"

    - Sanctification is obviously a condition, or means to achiving and "eye single" to God's glory.
